# UniLab Authoring Workbench

The formal browser-targeted Theia application for one managed-local Uni-Lab OS
Workspace. The Theia Workspace and OS WorkspaceSource use the same normalized
Editable Package root. Runtime state and diagnostics are stored below
`<workspace>/.unilabos/`.

## Start with SZLab

```bash
THEIA_WORKSPACE=/absolute/path/to/Uni-Lab-SZLab \
UNILAB_OS_PROJECT=/absolute/path/to/Uni-Lab-OS \
UNILAB_PYTHON_ENV=/absolute/path/to/conda/env \
pnpm workbench
```

`UNILAB_PYTHON_ENV` is optional when the active environment or a standard local
Conda location contains both Python and the `unilab` CLI. An explicitly selected
environment is authoritative: if it becomes invalid, Workbench fails closed and
does not silently switch environments.

When an environment is selected, the launcher gives Theia's Python extension,
integrated terminals and the managed OS the same activated `PATH`, `CONDA_PREFIX`
and `PYTHONPATH` view (OS source root plus Editable Package root).

Open <http://127.0.0.1:3100>. The Workbench backend owns OS startup, readiness,
logs, PID identity and shutdown. Material and Workflow surfaces remain disabled
until the managed OS reports health, workflow-template and device-catalog
readiness.
